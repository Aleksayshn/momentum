# MOMENTUM
Momentum is an analogue of the eponymous Chrome extension for an online store. The application shows the time and the user's name. The background image and greeting change depending on the time of day.

The application features a clock, image slider, weather widgets, audio player, quote of the day block, and settings. Local storage is used to store the user's name and location.
